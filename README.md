# Modern_Calculator
## Aim:
To create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides an interactive interface with buttons for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The calculator will have a display screen to show user input and results, utilizing the CSS grid system for button alignment and JavaScript for handling user input and performing calculations.

## Description:
This project involves building a simple, yet functional calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator interface will include buttons for numbers 0-9, decimal point, arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a clear (AC) button, and a delete (DEL) button. The calculator will display the input and results on a screen, and the layout will be styled using CSS to ensure responsiveness and an appealing design. JavaScript will be used to manage the calculator's logic and handle user interactions.

## Technologies:
HTML: For creating the structure of the calculator.
CSS: For styling the calculator interface, ensuring it is responsive and visually appealing.
JavaScript: For implementing the calculator logic, handling user inputs, and performing calculations.
## Procedure:
Setup HTML Structure:

Create a basic HTML file with a structure for the calculator, including a display area and buttons for numbers and operations.
Use form elements and buttons to create the input and controls for the calculator.
Style with CSS:

Use CSS to style the calculator, ensuring it is responsive and visually appealing.
Apply CSS grid for button alignment and layout.
Add hover and active states for buttons to enhance the user experience.
Implement JavaScript Logic:

Create JavaScript functions to handle user inputs, update the display, clear the display, delete the last character, and perform calculations.
Use event listeners to detect button clicks and trigger the appropriate functions.
Implement basic arithmetic operations and handle edge cases (e.g., division by zero).
Test and Debug:

Test the calculator to ensure all buttons and operations work correctly.
Debug any issues and make necessary adjustments to the code.

## Result:
The result is a fully functional, responsive calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. The calculator has a clean and user-friendly interface with buttons for digits, decimal point, arithmetic operations, and control functions (AC and DEL). The display screen shows user inputs and results, and the calculator handles various edge cases gracefully.
